# Food-Waste-Management-System
A Food Waste Management System connects surplus food providers like restaurants and households with NGOs or individuals in need. Users can list available food, view locations, and claim items, ensuring edible food is distributed instead of wasted, helping reduce hunger and promote sustainability.
