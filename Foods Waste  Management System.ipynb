ðŸ“œ Introduction:
Food wastage is one of the major global issues, with millions of tons of edible food being discarded every year while millions of people still suffer from hunger. The Food Waste Management System is designed to minimize this gap by connecting food donorsâ€”such as restaurants, hotels, households, and eventsâ€”with NGOs, charities, and individuals in need. This system not only helps in reducing waste but also supports social welfare and environmental sustainability.

ðŸ“Œ Description:
The Food Waste Management System is a digital platform where food providers can list surplus or leftover food, including details like quantity, freshness, and pickup location. NGOs or individuals in need can browse available listings and request the food. The system uses a database to store food information, donor and recipient details, and manages the food request process. It also provides tracking, analytics, and notifications to ensure timely pickup and minimize spoilage. By leveraging technology, this system promotes resource sharing, reduces landfill waste, and helps fight hunger.
